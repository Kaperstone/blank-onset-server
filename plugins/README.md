## Plugins directory

This is the plugins directory, all third party plugins that aren't Lua scripts are to be put here.
Plugins extend Lua scripting by providing third party tools and/or faster/better solutions.

To load a plugin, put the plugin in this directory and add the name of the plugin to your `server_config.json`
