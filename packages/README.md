# Packages directory

This is the head of your server project, mainly the `game mode` directory where the main files of your project are loaded, within them, the modules and everything else is loaded.

To load a package, create a folder in this directory with the name of the package you want to load and put there all the package files, afterwards add the package name to your `server_config.json`
