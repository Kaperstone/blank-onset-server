# Server package directory


Here should be placed all the package files and be loaded by including each in the `package.json` file.
The recommended structure is to have `client`, `server` and `gui` folders, each for files its meant for.

Although its not enforced and you can customize the directory structure as you wish, as long as its included in the `package.json` file proeprly.
